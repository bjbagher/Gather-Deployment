## Tensorflow deployment

1. Object Detection. _Flask SocketIO + WebRTC_

Stream from webcam using WebRTC -> Flask SocketIO to detect objects -> WebRTC -> Website.

2. Object Detection. _Flask SocketIO + opencv_

Stream from OpenCV -> Flask SocketIO to detect objects -> OpenCV.

3. Speech streaming. _Flask SocketIO_

Stream speech from microphone -> Flask SocketIO to do realtime speech recognition.

4. Text classification. _Flask + Gunicorn_

Serve Tensorflow text model using Flask multiworker + Gunicorn.

5. Image classification. _TF Serving_

Serve image classification model using TF Serving.

6. Image Classification using Inception. _Flask SocketIO_

Stream image using SocketIO -> Flask SocketIO to classify.

7. Object Detection. _Flask + opencv_

Webcam -> Opencv -> Flask -> web dashboard.

8. Face-detection using MTCNN. _Flask SocketIO + opencv_

Stream from OpenCV -> Flask SocketIO to detect faces -> OpenCV.

9. Face-detection using MTCNN. _opencv_

Webcam -> Opencv.

10. Image classification using Inception. _Flask + Docker_

Serve Tensorflow image model using Flask multiworker + Gunicorn on Docker container.

11. Image classification using Inception. _Flask + EC2 Docker Swarm + Nginx load balancer_

Serve inception on multiple AWS EC2, scale using Docker Swarm, balancing using Nginx.

12. Text classification. _Hadoop streaming MapReduce_

Batch processing to classify texts using Tensorflow text model on Hadoop MapReduce.

13. Text classification. _Kafka_

Stream text to Kafka producer and classify using Kafka consumer.

14. Text classification. _Distributed TF using Flask + Gunicorn + Eventlet_

Submit large texts using Flask, signal queue celery job to process using Hadoop, delay Hadoop MapReduce.

17. Text classification. _Luigi scheduler + Hadoop_

Submit large texts on Luigi scheduler, run Hadoop inside Luigi, event based Hadoop MapReduce.

18. Text classification. _Luigi scheduler + Distributed Celery_

Submit large texts on Luigi scheduler, run Hadoop inside Luigi, delay processing.

19. Text classification. _Airflow scheduler + elasticsearch + Flask_

Scheduling based processing using Airflow, store inside elasticsearch, serve it using Flask.

20. Text classification. _Apache Kafka + Apache Storm_

Stream from twitter -> Kafka Producer -> Apache Storm, to do distributed minibatch realtime processing.

## Notes

1. Deploy them on a server, change `local` in code snippets to your own IP.
2. WebRTC chrome only can tested on HTTPS server.
3. When come to real deployment, always prepare for up-scaling architectures. Learn about DevOps.
4. Please aware with your cloud cost!
